==============

An [Alpine](http://alpinelinux.org/) base-image used by Extesla as the
foundation for all other images. This base-image is slightly larger than
alpine core because it contains several utilities that make it easier to
interact with a container when you need to enter it.

For more details on the official alpine image, which this image builds on
top of, please visit: https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/
